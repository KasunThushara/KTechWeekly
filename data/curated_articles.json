New microcontrollers often have issues when they are first released, leading companies to issue errata listing bugs and potential fixes, as we ve previously seen with the Raspberry Pi RP2350 A4 stepping, which fixes the E9 GPIO Erratum with a new revision of the silicon. Espressif identified three issues with the ESP32-C5: PSRAM Reset Hang When ESP32-C5 series chips run ESP-IDF v5.5.1 with PSRAM enabled, CPU or digital reset operations may hang. This triggers a secondary RTC WDT reset. If the rollback feature (CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE, disabled by default) is enabled, this sequence may result in an OTA rollback. AES and SHA Access to PSRAM When ESP32-C5 chips run ESP-IDF v5.5.1, PSRAM data may be corrupted when AES or SHA hardware accesses buffers that are not aligned [...] The post ESP32-C5 bug advisory identifies and fixes PSRAM and sleep coexistence issues appeared first on CNX Software - Embedded Systems News .",
