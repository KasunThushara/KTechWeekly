NXP takes a different approach with their TJA1410 (automotive) and TJF1410 (industrial) Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) transceivers.

By integrating the digital portion of the PHY into the host microcontroller or switch, the TJA1410 and TJF1410 only need to handle the essential analog functions for transmitting and receiving signals over the physical medium.

The new standard utilizes MIPI M-PHY version 6.0 for the physical layer and UniPro version 3.0 for the protocol.

As a reminder, the previous UFS 4.0 standard promised up to 4,200 MB/s, so the upcoming UFS 5.0 standard more than doubles the theoretical speed.
