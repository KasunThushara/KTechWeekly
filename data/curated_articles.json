Ambient Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a class of IoT devices powered by radio waves, light, motion, heat, or any other viable ambient energy source. It is an evolution of legacy IoT and RFID technologies that promises lower costs and high scalability through Bluetooth, 5G Advanced, and the IEEE 802.11bp ambient power communication (AMP) standard. The alliance says its mission is to promote and support the development of an open, harmonized, and aligned multi-standard ecosystem . Ambient IoT-enabled devices can gather location, temperature, humidity, and/r other data, and communicate with the wireless infrastructure through a nearby mobile device, wireless access points, domestic appliances, or other standard gateways using a compatible standard.
