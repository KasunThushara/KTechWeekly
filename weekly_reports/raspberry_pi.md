### 3. DDR4 supply/demand stress leads to Raspberry Pi CM4/CM5 price increases ⭐⭐

**Importance:** 6/10

Rising DDR4 memory costs, driven by increased demand for AI workloads, are causing Raspberry Pi to raise prices on its Compute Module 4 and 5 devices. Specifically, 4GB and 8GB CM4/CM5 modules will increase by $5 and $10 respectively, and the Raspberry Pi 500 unit-only PC will also see a price hike. This reflects the overall impact of limited semiconductor supply on memory costs.

💡 *Rising memory costs are forcing Raspberry Pi to increase prices due to AI demand pressures.*
